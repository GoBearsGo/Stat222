Influential Factors of Posts’ Popularity Differences in Reddit
=======

Introduction:
----
The research topic is Influential Factors of Posts’ Popularity differences in Reddit. From Wikipedia, Reddit is a social news and entertainment website where regis- tered users submit content. Content entries are organized by areas of interest called ’subreddits’. I am going to change the mind of Authors and Readers of Reddit. I want to help the authors know which factors related to a post have impact on the differences among popularity (scores) of these 2,500 already popular SubReddits. Factors are such as posted time, the author and number of comments. Therefore, I could give the authors suggestions to make their posts more popular. Similarly, for the readers, I could recommend more popular posts to them.

Questions to Answer:
----
* <strong>Whose Mind I Am Going to Change? </strong>
    - Authors and Readers of Reddit.
* <strong>About What? </strong>
    - Authors: Which factors related to a post have impact on the differences among popularity (scores) of these 2,500 already popular SubReddits. Give the authors suggestions to make their posts more popular.
    - Readers: Recommend more popular posts to them. 

Data for Analysis:

The data I am using is "Reddit Top 2.5 Million". It is a dataset with the 1,000 all-time top posts from the top 2,500 most-subscribed subreddits. I use Score to indicate popularity. The explanatory variables are Domain (the post is self post or not), Number of comments, Number of times a particular author appears in dataset, The author edits the post or not, Post time for each post, The SubReddit score ranges a post comes from.
